About
Welcome to my capstone blog project! This website is built with a blend of modern web development technologies to provide a seamless and engaging user experience.

Frontend
The frontend of the blog is designed using the Clean Blog template from StartBootstrap and additional customizations inspired by a CodePen example (view on CodePen). This combination ensures a clean, professional look and feel, optimized for readability and user engagement. The responsive design ensures the blog looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

Backend
The backend is powered by ExpressJS, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, ensuring a robust server-side infrastructure. The templates are rendered using EJS (Embedded JavaScript), allowing for dynamic content rendering and smooth integration between the server and client sides.

Features
Dynamic Content: Easily add, edit, and delete blog posts.
Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
Interactive Elements: Enhanced user experience with interactive elements powered by jQuery.
Random Activity Generator: Integrated with the Bored API to suggest random activities.
