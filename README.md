  **About**

Welcome to my capstone blog project! This website is built with a blend of modern web development technologies to provide a seamless and engaging user experience.

   **Frontend**

The frontend of the blog is designed using the Clean Blog template from StartBootstrap and additional customizations inspired by a CodePen example (https://codepen.io/creativemanner/pen/NWrNWrd). This combination ensures a clean, professional look and feel, optimized for readability and user engagement. The responsive design ensures the blog looks great on both desktop and mobile devices.

  **Backend**

The backend is powered by ExpressJS, a fast and minimalist web framework for Node.js, ensuring a robust server-side infrastructure. The templates are rendered using EJS (Embedded JavaScript), allowing for dynamic content rendering and smooth integration between the server and client sides.

 **Features**

Dynamic Content: Easily add, edit, and delete blog posts.

Responsive Design: Optimized for both desktop and mobile viewing.
